# Architecture

The architecture of `go-ibft` is lean, and doesnâ€™t impose an implementation overhead on the side of packages using it.

## Terminology

`View` - view is considered to be a tuple (height, round number), for which consensus is being orchestrated
`Round` - the current round number of the IBFT consensus mechanism
`Height `- the current block height of the IBFT consensus mechanism
`Sequence` - an alternate name for `Height`
`Quorum` - the number of nodes needed to reach consensus. Usually implemented as `ceil(2*n/3)`, where `n` is the number of validators in the network
`Max faulty nodes` - the number of tolerated faulty (byzantine) nodes in the network. Usually implemented as `floor((n-1)/3)`, where `n` is the number of validators in the network
