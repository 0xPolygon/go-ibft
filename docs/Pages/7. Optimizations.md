# Optimizations

This document details what optimizations from the analysis document, as well as the IBFT 2.0 document are present in `go-ibft`.

## Quorum(Prepare + Commit) Messages

A node that is currently in the **Prepare** state, but does not have Quorum PREPARE messages cannot move over to **Commit** state, and will eventually time out if they don’t arrive in time.

An optimization present for this problem can be found in the form of COMMIT messages.

If the node, who is in **Prepare** state doesn’t have Quorum of valid PREPARE messages, but does have Quorum of valid PREPARE and COMMIT messages, it can move over to **Commit** state.
