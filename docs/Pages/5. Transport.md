# Transport

The `Transport` interface details the message passing mechanism between nodes that `go-ibft` requires in order to achieve consensus.

```go
// Transport defines an interface
// the node uses to communicate with other peers
type Transport interface {
	// Multicast multicasts the message to other peers
	Multicast(message *proto.Message)
}
```

IBFT is a message-reliant protocol, meaning it relies on messages being sent and received in order to function. The implementation of the `Transport` interface should make sure that messages are delivered in a safe and fast manner to achieve maximum consensus speed.
